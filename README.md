# Google Data Analytics Certificate

### **Hey!**
I am so excited to introduce my work on this new and one of the most discussed courses on Coursera — `Google Data Analytics Certificate.`
This repository *includes* my **complete** notes that I took during the courses and also in my way. 

### What to Expect?
This is the complete summary of the certificate program which I am used to refer when I needed. I started writing them since the first day
of taking this course. And I completed 3 full scape books for this. Now, I know my fonts / handwriting might not be clear but hey, if you
want a quick (not that quick - but instead of 6 months, you need to give your day or 2) learning experience, then you should take this.

I have made this book by doing some pretty highlighting and tried to write in clear way, but actually while writing, it wasn't in my mind
that I am making this for everyone so the language might be harsh somewhere.

### How to Read?
I have split the folders in neat way and course-wise. All folders are having the week-wise book pages in the `.pdf` format. I recommend you
to download them and then read. Which might cost you ~150 MB of data. The pages are captured in the chronological order so you will feel it
like a story being told about data analysis!

All of the main points are covered, noted and highlighted there.

### Tone
As said, I made it keeping that in mind that I was making for personla use, so I have included some explicit words there just to ephesize
the tone and the concept there. Nothing rude going on there so please don't take personally!

### Copyright?
I don't think I am leaking stuff here, it is just my notes. But if Google feels in the wrong way, who knows?


Huge Thanks!
